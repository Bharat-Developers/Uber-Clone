ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Uber Clone! ðŸš€
We are really excited to share my latest project with you all: a ride-hailing app inspired by Uber! Iâ€™ve put together a cool tech stack and packed it with features that make booking and managing rides a breeze. Here's a glimpse into what this project offers:
ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
* Frontend: Next.js
* Backend: Node.js
* Authentication: JWT
* Real-time Communication: Socket.io
* Data Visualization: Chart.js
* Database: MongoDB
* Mapping: Leaflet
ðŸŒŸ Features:
* Driver Signup & Login: Seamlessly onboard drivers and manage their profiles.
* Driver Dashboard: View and manage profile, past rides, and other key information.
* Rider Signup & Login: Easy registration and login for riders.
* Ride Booking: Select pickup and drop-off locations directly on the map.
* Cab Type Selection: Choose from various cab types to suit your needs.
* Real-Time Map: See nearby drivers within a 3 km radius.
* Driver Path Visualization: Track the driverâ€™s journey from current position to pickup and from pickup to drop-off.
* Trip Cancellation: Option to cancel a ride when needed.
This project demonstrates the power of integrating various technologies to build a seamless and functional ride-hailing application. Iâ€™m excited about the potential of this application and look forward to any feedback or suggestions you might have!
Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss the project in more detail or collaborate on future endeavors. ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
